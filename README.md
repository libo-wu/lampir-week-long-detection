### This project consists several parts:###
 * LAMPIR driven code, based on arduino
 * Raspberry Pi code for camera, data storage
 * Human detection of photos and analog data analyzing


### How do I get set up? ###
1. LAMPIR is as a slave of Raspi. it runs arduino continuously. 
2. Raspi runs python code, with multithread to collect data (plot) and storage photos. See (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_multithreading.htm)
3. Filename is based on the time.
4. Picamera takes photos every 1 min, or when triggerred.
   *  When the analog signal exceeds a value, take photos.
